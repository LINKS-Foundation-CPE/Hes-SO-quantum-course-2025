        "Qiskit provides a number of [Algorithms](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/algorithms.html) and they are grouped by category according to the task they can perform. For instance `Minimum Eigensolvers` to find the smallest eigen value of an operator, for example ground state energy of a chemistry Hamiltonian or a solution to an optimization problem when expressed as an Ising Hamiltonian. There are `Time Evolvers` for the time evolution of quantum systems and `Amplitude Estimators` for value estimation that can be used say in financial applications. The full set of categories can be seen in the Algorithms documentation link above.\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithms are configurable and often part of the configuration will be in the form of smaller building blocks, of which different instances of the building block type can be given. For instance with `VQE`, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, it takes a trial wavefunction, in the form of a `QuantumCircuit` and a classical optimizer among other things.\n",

        "Let's take a look at an example to construct a VQE instance. Here `TwoLocal` is the variational form (trial wavefunction), a parameterized circuit which can be varied, and `SLSQP` a classical optimizer. These are created as separate instances and passed to VQE when it is constructed. Trying, for example, a different classical optimizer, or variational form is simply a case of creating an instance of the one you want and passing it into VQE."
